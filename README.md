# ToDo-App-Javascript
<br>

> As the name suggest this app allows you to list your all tasks that needs to be completed and remove from the task from the list once completed.
<br>
Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make you feel grounded. Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused.

As you cross items off your to-do list, you'll feel a sense of progress and accomplishment that can be missed when rushing from one activity to the next. The affirmation that you are making progress will help motivate you to keep moving forward rather than feeling overwhelmed.
<br>
Having a list of all your tasks will allow you to sit down and make a plan. One study showed that fifteen minutes spent planning could save an hour of execution time!
